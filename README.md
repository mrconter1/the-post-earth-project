# The Post-Earth Project

The goal of this project is to conceptualize and build upon the idea of humanity existing beyond the confines of any planet. It explores the potential for humans to live and thrive in space, examining what a space-faring human civilization might look like.

Let's begin with a broad overview of human life in this context. It's reasonable to assume that there would need to be living quarters equipped with artificial gravity. Reasonable, an entire civilization-scale community could consist of numerous separate space stations, each producing different goods. Transportation between these stations would need to be standardized and efficient to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.

From a high-level perspective, it seems logical to model each station with the following considerations:

- Its specific orbit around the sun
- The average production of a set of products, measured in tons
- The average consumption of a set of products, also measured in tons

Initially, this project will prioritize materials based on necessity and will operate under the assumption that the infrastructure for gathering and processing these materials already exists.

## Standard Habitat

We will start with constructing a standard habitat. Each person would have approximately 100 square meters on average where 20 square meters out of those would be private.

Let us assume a rotating ring with a radius of around 250 meters. The ring would consist of three levels, each of which would be three meters, and it would be 15 meters wide.

That would amount to around 70 000 square meters of habitat area, meaning that it would be able to host around 700 people.

## Food Producing Station

If we assume that each person would need to have approximately 100 cubic meter of growing space to continuously produce food there would need to be 70 000 cubic meter needed. For simplicity, we will make this volume into a cube and assume each side of it to be approximately 50 meters.
