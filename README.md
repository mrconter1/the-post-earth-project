# The Post-Earth Project

This projects goal is to envision and build on the conceptional world of humanity outside the bounderies of any planet. It investigates how a space living and thriving species might look in the context of humans.

Let us start with a general overview of how human life would look like. Presumably their would have to be living quarters with artificial gravity. And reasonable the whole civilization-scale community would be made up of a lot of seperate space stations producing different things. Transportation in between this would in order words have to be standardized and efficient.
